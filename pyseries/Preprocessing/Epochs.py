Epochs
======

Making epochs (i.e slicing the signal) around events. 
After epoching analysis can be performed, like erp's or spectrograms.

def Make_Epochs_for_Channels(recording, ch_names, epochs_info):
    """Epochs are pieces of signal which happened right after and/or before an event.
    
       `epochs_info` defines type of events and size of the epoch. 
       `ch_names` defines which channles to make epochs from.
       
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    recording: dict
        contains EEG channels, events and timestamps
    ch_names: list(str)
        List of channels to create epochs from
    epochs_info: dict
        Key is event name, value is an array [n_samples_back, n_samples_before]
    
    Returns
    -------
    epochs: dict
        Epoched signal organized in a dictionary.
        Keys are event names, values are epochs (np.arrays)
        
        
    Examples
    --------
    >>> import pyseries.LoadingData as loading
    >>> import pyseries.Preprocessing as prep
    
    First load the complete experiment recording, it will contain all EEG chanels, events log and timestamps:
    
    >>> recording = loading.Read_edf.Combine_EDF_XML('/Users/user/Desktop/Nagrania/rest/Rysiek_03_06/',True)
    
    Ten specify which events from the events log are to be used for epochs and their time from the event.
    Epochs will be created only from events which name match those provided by keys in epochs info dictionary.
    Values in epochs infor dictionary are [n_samples_before, n_samples_forward]         
    
    >>> epochs_info = {'Eyes Open': [0: 500 * 140], 'Eyes Closed': [0: 500 *140]}         
    
    Now you can make epochs:

    >>> epochs= prep.Epochs.Make_Epochs_for_Channels(recording, ['EEG O1', 'EEG O2',  'EEG P3', 'EEG P4'],epochs_info)
