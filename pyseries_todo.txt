#I/O
-add info to expect error when polish characters are in xml file - deal by manually changing them

#VISUALIZE
-change all plotting functions that iterate over unkown number of different colors to use seaborn pallete with next()

#OPTIMIZE
-convert the recording into 2D numpy array, and when needed retrieve the ch names as row names. Then perform all operations on this numpy array and not on dict -> for example in make epochs this will speed things up, no need to make epochs for each channel separately

>> import itertools
ax=fig.add_subplot(111)
palette = itertools.cycle(sns.color_palette())
for f in files:
    ax.scatter(args, color=next(palette))

-make sure not to return values where operations are by reference anyways: Preprocessing.prepare functions≈õ

-Convert recording to object for fuck sake
